Introduction to basic arcades like dodger and the snakes game
## [Dodger](https://github.com/KudoS1410/hello_world/blob/master/p3.py):
* It involves dodgining random waves of thrown articles 
* Speed is impossible for winning a certain set of rounds
## [Snakes](https://github.com/KudoS1410/hello_world/blob/master/t1.py) :
* Normal wrapping allowable snakes game in which food can spawn inside the snake 
* Maybe we can consider it already eaten or maybe check until valid random position choose wisely
